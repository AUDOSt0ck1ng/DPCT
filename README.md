It's my master's thesis and implementation code.

## Introduction
Based on the implementation of [SDT]( https://github.com/dailenson/SDT ), the training process is modified, and the content encoder is used to extract potential content features of style samples for other subsequent comparative learning applications.

Thanks for their great work !!
